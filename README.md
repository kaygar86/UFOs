# UFOs

# Overview of Project:
The purpose of this analysis is to give users a tool to easily filter through UFO sighting data. The user can now type one or more filters into the search boxes and the list will show the filtered results. 

# Results:

The new design features more filters than our original design, which could only filter by date. Now the user can filter by date, city, state, country, and shape. You can also run more than one filter at a time to show even more focused results. The user types the filter in the search box or boxes and presses Enter, then the filtered list shows up with the results. 
## Example with no filters on

# Summary:

One drawback to the current design is that it's not totally clear what is being filtered and there is no easy way to reset the filter. An improvement which would make it clearer as to what is being filtered is to return the current filters that are on above the list of sightings. Right now if you submit the filter and then type something else in the search box and forget to press Enter it still shows you the last filter you ran. For example, in the imporoved design if you filtered for Date: 1/5/2010 and City: rockwell the filters would show up with labels above the list as "1/5/2010" and "rockwell". It would also be helpful to have a clear filter button so you can easily start over again. This could be added right below the filter search boxes.
